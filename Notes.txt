* Decomposition of ILInstructions into IRInstructions

Create IRGenericInstantiations for IRTypes
Create IRGenericInstantiations for IRField types
Create IRGenericInstantiations for IRMethod return and parameter types
Create IRGenericInstantiations for IRLocal types

* Build control flow graph
* Fix linearization of values remaining from inside branches, IE ternary operations, and if (x == null || y == null) scenario (source coming from 2 branches)
* Linearization of IRInstructions
Linearization of Exception Handlers, and Finally Handlers
* Transform Load/Store to Move IRInstructions
Transform instructions that behave like other instructions under certain conditions, IE unbox.any to castclass when dealing with a reference type

* Complete instruction cloning
Complete instruction resolving of types, methods, and fields held by the instruction
Complete linearized source/destination cloning and resolving

Generate mandatory internal calls, IE object conversion to and from pointer for GC
Resolve internal calls, limiting internal calls for mandatory calls only means resolution on name without signatures might be enough for AOT side only
